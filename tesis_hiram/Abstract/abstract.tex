I present a study on the  production of tH in same sign dimuon channel $\mu\pm \mu\pm$ 
 A likelihood scan is performed to show the probability of observation of the signal.  By studying this process , I explore a Higgs production mechanism ,which it has not been observed yet experimentally. Simulation is used to predict sensitivity for the LHC high luminosity phase. This could help to obtain better limits for the production of tH. I also include the model $k_t=-1$, where $k_t$ is the top higgs coupling parameter,  for compare it with the standard model.
